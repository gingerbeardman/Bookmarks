**Bookmarks** provides sidebar integration with the ability to bookmark files.

Ideal if the Files Sidebar is too much, or you want a simpler view of the files you are working on.

## Usage

To use Bookmarks:

1. Select the **View → Sidebars → Show All Sidebars** menu item
2. Click **Bookmarks** sidebar icon

For more frequent access you can drag the **Bookmarks** icon to:

- the **Sidebar Dock** for toggling between sidebars
- to a window edge to have a split sidebar

## Adding/Removing

Use the `+` icon in the sidebar to add the current file as a bookmark.

Use the `-` icon in the sidebar to remove the currently selected file bookmark.

There are also two editor commands to add/remove the current file.

Finally, you can right click on a bookmark to bring up a context menu with the following options:

- Remove
- Show in Finder
