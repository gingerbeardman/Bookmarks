**Bookmarks** provides sidebar integration with the ability to bookmark files and folders.

Ideal if the Files Sidebar is too much, or you want a simpler view of the files you are working on.

## Usage

To use Bookmarks:

1. Select the **View → Sidebars → Show All Sidebars** menu item
2. Click **Bookmarks** sidebar icon

For more frequent access you can drag the **Bookmarks** icon to:

- the **Sidebar Dock** for toggling between sidebars
- to a window edge to have a split sidebar

## Adding/Removing

Use the `+` icon in the sidebar to add the current file as a bookmark.

Use the `-` icon in the sidebar to remove the currently selected file bookmark.

There are also two editor commands to add/remove the current file.

Finally, you can right click on a bookmark to bring up a context menu with the following options:

- Remove
- Show in Finder

## Folders

You can use an editor command to "Add Folder Bookmark".

> Due to Nova limitations clicking on a folder uses AppleScript automation to focus it in the Files sidebar.

## Missing

Missing files are marked with a chain link icon.

They can be removed manually, or the Refresh command will remove all missing files/folders.

> Due to Nova limitations missing items cannot be greyed out or disabled.
